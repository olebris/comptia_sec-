    - unusual event (network activity, uncommon login patterns, change of file hash …)
    - ip, dns, files that are not usual and related to CTI ALERT / THREAT
    - concurrent sessions
    - strange geolocation / impossible travel
    - anormal connection hours
    - blocked security control (edr shutdown )
    - unusual bandwith spike
    - ressource consumption
    - ressource inacessibility
    - new encrypted data ⇒ ransomware ?
    - missing logs
    - out of cycle logging
        - something in the log at a strange timeframe (ex : patch outside of patching day)
