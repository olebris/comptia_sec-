- UPS - Uninterruptible Power Supply
    - offline / standby UPS ( take relay if power line is down)
    - line_interactive UPS (increase voltage if problem or drop on the main power line)
    - online UPS ( always ON, you are always on battery )
- Generator
    - fuel based electricity
    - take time to start . Use UPS while the generator is starting
