    - Not working anymore w/ WPA3 (encrypted management frames)
- bluetooth
    - bluejacking : send unsolicited messages

    - protect deauth attacks
    - encrypt some management frames
        - disassociation

        - association
- Radio Frequency Jamming
    - DoS by interfering with wireless signals

    - send constants or big amount of legitimate frames

Remediation w/ FOX Hunting

- with directionnal antenna searching for the jamming source
