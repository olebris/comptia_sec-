**Vulnerability management** programs play a crucial role in identifying,
prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities in our environments.

They use **vulnerability scanning** to detect new vulnerabilities as they
arise and then implement a remediation workflow that addresses the
highest-priority vulnerabilities. Every organization should incorporate
vulnerability management into their cybersecurity program.

- Scans
    - credentialed vs non credentialed
    - intrusive vs non intrusive
- Identifying scan Targets
    - Use tools for asset inventory via scans (ex:Qalys vulnerability scanner)
    - Define Asset criticality
- Determining Scan Frequency
    - Frequency depends on:
        - Organization appetite (risk tolerance)
        - Regulatory requirements (PCI DSS, FISMA)
        - Technical constraints
        - Business constraints
        - Licensing limitations
- Define scanning templates (config in Vuln. Scanner)
    - deactivate non useful plugin
    - be careful with intrusive plugins
    - adds READ ONLY credential for more accurate scans â‡’ credentialed scanning
    - verify the vulnerability feeds remain up-to-date.
- Vulnerability Scanners (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys, Nexpose â€¦)
    - port scan
    - identify devices
    - create reports
    - server based scan (from a remote position in the network)
    - agent based scan (from inside the server)

The internal and external scans required by PCI DSS
are a good example of scans performed from different perspectives.
The organization may conduct its own internal scans but must
supplement them with external scans conducted by an Approved
Scanning Vendor (ASV).
