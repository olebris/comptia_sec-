Cybersecurity efforts are all about risk management. In this chapter,
you learned about the techniques that cybersecurity analysts use to
identify, assess, and manage a wide variety of risks. You learned about
the differences between risk mitigation, risk avoidance, risk
transference, and risk acceptance and when it is appropriate to use
each. You also learned how the disaster recovery planning process can
help prevent disruptions to a business, and we discussed the role of
security professionals in protecting the privacy of personally
identifiable information.

**Risk identification and assessment helps organizations
prioritize cybersecurity efforts**. Cybersecurity analysts seek to
identify all of the risks facing their organization and then conduct a
business impact analysis to assess the potential degree of risk based on
the probability that it will occur and the magnitude of the potential
effect on the organization. This work allows security professionals to
prioritize risks and communicate risk factors to others in the
organization.

**Vendors are a source of external risk**. Organizations should
conduct their own systems assessments as part of their risk
assessment practices, but they should also conduct supply chain
assessments as well. Performing vendor due diligence reduces the
likelihood that a previously unidentified risk at a vendor will
negatively impact the organization. Hardware source authenticity
techniques verify that hardware was not tampered with after leaving
the vendor's premises.

**Organizations may choose from a variety of risk
management strategies**. Risk avoidance strategies change business
practices to make a risk irrelevant to the organization. Risk mitigation
techniques seek to reduce the probability or magnitude of a risk. Risk
transference approaches move some of the risk to a third party. Risk
acceptance acknowledges the risk and continues normal business
operations despite the presence of the risk.

**Disaster recovery planning builds resiliency**. Disaster recovery
plans activate when an organization experiences a natural or human-
made disaster that disrupts its normal operations. The disaster
recovery plan helps the organization quickly recover its information
and systems and resume normal operations.

**Privacy controls protect personal information.** Organizations
handling sensitive personal information should develop privacy
programs that protect that information from misuse and unauthorized
disclosure. The plan should cover personally identifiable information
(PII), protected health information (PHI), financial information, and
other records maintained by the organization that might impact
personal privacy
