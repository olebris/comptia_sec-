- Policy : rules / mandatory principles . Common goal to reach. You must follow the policy
- Guidelines : Recommandations. Non mandatory
- Procedure: Step by Step actions to follow a policy
- Baseline : Best practices + minimum configuration
- ARO: Annual Rate of Occurence (in risk management)
- AUP :Acceptable use policy (AUP)- A document that provides network and system users with
clear direction on permissible uses of information resources.
- ACL - Access Control List - rules to allow/deny actions

access control model that uses policies that include multiple attributes for rules

- BPA  business partners agreement.
- BPDU bridge protocol data unit.
- CASB  cloud access security broker
- CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Pro-
tocol) Encryption technology used in the WPA2 protocol. It implements AES (Advanced
Encryption Standard) with a 128-bit key as a stream cipher.
- CPS : This is defined in the certificate practice statement.(CPS). The CPS states the practices a CA employs when issuing or managing certificates. Also describe documentation for maintaining certificates and why CA can be trusted
- CRL: Certificate revocation list (CRL)
- CLE: Column-level encryption (CLE)
- CN: Common name (CN) Clearly describes the certificate owner
- EAP-TLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security) Implements
certificate-based authentication as well as mutual authentication of the device and network.
- EAP : Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) An authentication expansion system where
new or custom mechanisms that perform authentication can be added to existing systems.Used in NAC Network Access Control / 802.1X/Radius/TACACS+
- ECC : Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) Theory to develop secure cryptographic systems
- ESP: Encapsulating security payload (ESP) Operates in either transport mode or tunnel mode.
In tunnel mode, it provides integrity and authentication for the entire packet
- EOL : End of life (EOL) A term used by original equipment manufacturers to note that the
device or system is no longer being produced and will no longer be marketed or sold after a
given date.
- EOSL: End- of-service life (EOSL) A term used by original equipment manufacturers meaning that
the OEM no longer sells, updates, or provides service for devices or systems
- ERM: Enterprise risk management (ERM) A formal approach to risk analysis that begins with
identifying risks, continues with determining the severity of each risk, and then results in
adopting one or more risk management strategies to address each risk.
- FDE  Full- disk encryption
- FIM:  File integrity monitor (FIM) Creates a signature or fingerprint for a file, and then monitors
the file and filesystem for changes to monitored files. FIM focuses on unexpected and unin-
tended changes.
- HIPAA  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
- HIPS  host-based intrusion prevention system
- ICS Industrial control system.
- IKE (Internet Key Exchange) A protocol used to set up a secure association as part of the
IPSec protocol suite.
- IV: Initialization vector (IV) A nonce (random parameter) used by numerous cryptography solutions to increase the strength of encrypted data by increasing the randomness of the input.
- ISAKMP  Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol. A framework for key exchange and authentication.
- ISO 27001 A standard covering security control objectives for information systems
- ISO 27002 A standard describing the actual controls that an organization may implement
to  meet cybersecurity objectives.
- ISO 27701 A standard that contains guidance for managing privacy controls.
- ISO 31000 A standard that provides guidelines for risk management programs.
- MTBF Mean time between failures (MTBF) A measure of the reliability of a system. It is the
expected amount of time that will elapse between system failures.
- MTTR Mean time to repair (MTTR) The average amount of time to restore a system to its normal
operating state after a failure
- MOA Memorandum of agreement (MOA) A formal document that outlines the terms and
details of an agreement between parties, establishing a mutual understanding of the roles and
responsibilities in fulfilling specific objectives. ⇒ Convention d’Accord
- MOU Memorandum of understanding (MOU) A letter written to document aspects of the
relationship. Flexible / initial Agreement ⇒ Lettre d’intention
- MSP See Managed service provider.
- MSSP See Managed security service provider.
- MTBF See Mean time between failures.
- MTTR See Mean time to repair.
- NTS Network Time Security (NTS) A secure version of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
- NAC: Network access control (NAC) Focuses on determining whether a system or device should
be allowed to connect to a network
- OCSP Online Certificate Status Protocol
- PAM Privileged access management (PAM)
- PHI:  Protected health information.
- PII : Personally identifiable information (PII).
- RA: Registration authority.
- RTOS: Real-time operating system (RTOS)
- RTO: Recovery time objective (RTO) The amount of time in which you think you can feasibly
recover function in the event of a disruption. RTO = Objectif | MTTR = mesure réelle
- RMF  Risk management framework.
- RoE  Rules of engagement
- RBAC: Role-based access control (RBAC) A form of nondiscretionary access control that
employs job function roles to regulate subject access to objects
- RPO: Recovery point objective (RPO) A measure of how much loss can be accepted by the orga-
nization when a disaster occurs. RPO is the maximum amount of time that can elapse bet-
ween your backups, thus determining how much data could be lost in a disaster.
- SASE  Secure access service edge.
- SAE: Simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) An authentication method in WPA-3 that
relies on a secure password-based authentication and password-authenticated key agreement
to prevent brute- force attacks like those that would be used against preshared keys
- SCADA  Supervisory control and data acquisition.
- SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) An effort by the security community,
led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to create a standardized
approach for communicating security- related information. This standardization is important
to the automation of interactions between security components
- SDN Software- defined networking (SDN).
- SD-WAN  Software- defined wide area networks (SD-WAN)
