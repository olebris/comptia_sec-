Security professionals need to understand how secure networks are
designed. Infrastructure considerations that security professionals
must take into account include the organization's attack surface, where
devices are logically and physically placed, and how security zones will
be established based on organizational requirements. Then,
connectivity requirements, including speed and latency, need to be
accounted for and failure modes, including if devices should fail open
to maintain access or fail closed to ensure security, should be
determined. Concepts like physical isolation and air-gapping and
logical segmentation help create barriers to attacks and exploits. High-
availability design concepts ensure that systems remain online despite
issues or disasters. Secure protocols are used to keep data secure in
transit.

Modern networks also rely on the ability to be controlled by software
as part of software-defined networks. SD-WANs (software-defined
wide area networks) take this concept outside of the local organization
to manage connectivity. SASE helps to protect devices regardless of
their location since organizations often operate in more than one
place. Finally, zero trust concepts move organizations from traditional
layered defenses to a continuous validation and authorization model.
Network access control (NAC), 802.1X, and port security all help
control access to the network itself. Validating machines and their
security stance can help ensure that only secure devices are allowed on
the network. VPNs provide secure remote access and protect
organizational data in transit by tunneling through other, untrusted
networks.

Many of the security tools are available as security appliances and
devices. Secure access via jump boxes lets administrators safely cross
security boundaries. Load balancers, proxy servers, and web filters
provide network capabilities, whereas firewalls, IDS and IPS devices,
and DLP tools provide focused security functionality. Security and
device management design options include out-of-band management
techniques, access control lists, quality-of-service functionality,
routing protocol security options, DNS security configurations, broad
use of TLS and TLS-enabled services, SNMP and monitoring tools, and
even tools used to capture and analyze attacker tools and techniques
like honeynets and honeypots. Regardless of the type of network
device, it should be hardened as part of its configuration process.

Using secure protocols and services instead of insecure versions and
understanding the limitations and implementation requirements for
each protocol and service is also important. Once attackers are in a
network, they will attempt to gain access to network traffic, and secure
protocols will help ensure that traffic an attacker intercepts will not be
easily accessible to them. Options like secure email, FTP, HTTP, and
Secure Shell are all part of the secure network design toolkit.

Even with all of these defenses in place, you need to be able to identify
a number of attacks: on-path attacks, DNS, credential replay, and
distributed denial-of-service attacks. Each of these attacks has
identifiable characteristics, ranging from traffic patterns to switch
behavior.

**The foundation of network security is a secure design.**
Networks must be designed with security in mind. Considerations
include the attack surface of the network and its attached devices,
which drives placement and segmentation into different security zones
based on risk or security requirements. Understanding what will
happen when failures occur and dealing with those failures also
influences design and choices around high availability. NAC and
802.1X protect networks from untrusted devices being connected,
whereas port security and port-level protections like loop prevention
and broadcast storm protection ensure that malicious or
misconfigured systems do not cause network issues. Network taps and
monitoring ports allow packet capture by creating a copy of traffic
from other ports. VPNs are used to tunnel network traffic to another
location, and they can be encrypted or simply tunneled. Key concepts
like physical isolation, logical segmentation, use of secure protocols,
use of reputation services, and tools like software-defined networking,
zero trust, SD-WAN, and SASE all have their place in secure network
design.

**Network appliances are used to provide security services to
networks and systems**. There are many types of network
appliances. Jump servers provide a secure way to access systems in
another security zone. Load balancers spread load among systems and
can use different scheduling options as well as operational modes like
active/active or active/passive designs. Proxy servers either centralize
connections from a group of clients out to a server or from a group of
servers out to clients, often as a load-balancing strategy. Web filters
filter content and URLs to limit what information can enter and exit a
network based on rules, and data loss prevention systems monitor to
ensure that data that shouldn't leave systems or networks is identified
and flagged, sent securely, or stopped. IDS and IPS devices identify
and take action based on malicious behavior, signatures, or anomalies
in traffic. Data collection devices like sensors and collectors help with
data gathering. Firewalls, including next-generation firewalls, web
application firewalls, and unified threat management appliances, are
used to build security zones and are placed at trust boundaries. UTM
devices combine many of these security features and capabilities into a
single appliance or system. Access control lists are used by many
devices, including switches and routers to determine what traffic can
flow through them based on rules.

**Network security services and management techniques help
make sure that a network stays secure**. Out-of-band
management puts management interfaces on a separate VLAN or
physical network or requires direct connection to help prevent
attackers from gaining access to management interfaces. DNS security
is also limited, but DNSSEC helps validate DNS servers and responses.
DNS servers must be properly configured to prevent zone transfers
and other DNS attacks. Email security leverages DMARC, DKIM, and
SPF to validate senders and domains. TLS is used broadly to protect
network traffic, acting as a wrapper for many other protocols.
Monitoring services and systems helps ensure that they remain online
and accessible but require care due to the amount of information that
can be generated and the fact that false positives are possible if the
validation and monitoring does not fully validate service responses.
File integrity monitors check to see if files have been changed and can
alert on changes or restore existing files to a pre-change or pre-
deletion state. Honeypots and honeynets are used to gather
information about attackers, and honeyfiles and honeytokens are used
to identify potential breaches and attackers who have gathered
information from systems in your environment. Network devices are
hardened, much like other devices, often based on standards and
benchmarks.

**Secure protocols provide ways to send and receive
information securely**. Many original Internet protocols are not
secureâ€”they do not provide encryption or authentication and can be
captured and analyzed or modified. Using secure versions of protocols
or using an alternate secure service and protocol is an important part
of ensuring that a network is secure. Key protocols include voice and
video protocols like SRTP; email protocols like IMAPS and POPS; and
security protocols like DMARC, DKIM, and SPF. File transfers can be
done via SFTP or FTPS instead of FTP, and directory services can be
moved from LDAP to LDAPS. Some protocols do not have as many or
as complete secure options. In fact, DNS, routing, and DHCP all have
limited options for secure communications. Network administrators
must take these into account while designing and operating their
networks.

**Network attacks drive network security decisions and
design**. On-path attacks redirect traffic through a system that an
attacker controls, allowing them to observe and potentially modify
traffic. DNS attacks include domain hijacking, DNS poisoning, and
URL redirection, but can be partially countered through the use of
DNSSEC. Credential replay attacks take advantage of poorly designed
or insecure protocols to send valid authentication hashes or other
artifacts pretending to be a legitimate user. Malicious code ranging
from worms to denial-of-service tools can impact networks and must
be accounted for in design. Denial-of-service attacks and distributed
denial-of-service attacks consume resources or target services to cause
them to fail. Reflected denial-of-service attacks use spoofed source
addresses to cause traffic to be sent to targets, whereas amplified
denial-of-service attacks use small queries to get large results,
amplifying their impact.
