- SLA
    - uptime, response time agreement
- MOU Memorandum of understanding ⇒ letter of intent / informal
- MOA Memorandum of Agreement ⇒ Next step after MOU
- BPA Business Process Agreement ⇒ Legal contract more formal and long term oriented
- MSA ⇒ Master Service Agreement : Framework / umbrella contract to cover later transactions
    - WO  Work Order /SOW Statement of work ⇒ DETAIL THE SCOPE

**MOU → MOA → BPA → SOW (si applicable) + NDA (si nécessaire)**
