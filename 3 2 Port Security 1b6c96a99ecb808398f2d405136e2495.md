- EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol
    - Authentication framework / Standard
    - based on RFC
    - integrates with 802.1X
    - NAC Network Access Control - based on 802.1X
- NAC / 802.x1 / EAP â‡’ you need to be authenticated to access the Network
- Used in conjonction with RADIUS, LDAP, TACACS+ ,Kerberos for the authentication
- NAC on Windows environment:
    - Client (via a 802.1X Switch) use EAP protocol to contact Radius server (NPS) with AD creds and device certificate
    - NPS/Radius use AD as Authentication server and if OK give access to the client via the 802.x1 Switch
