Identity and access management is a key element in organizational
security. Authentication is the process of proving your claim to an
identity by providing one or more factors that include something you
know, something you have, something you are, or somewhere you are.
Authorization provides authenticated users with the privileges and
rights they need to accomplish their roles. User accounts range from
guest and normal users to service accounts and privileged
administrative accounts. Account policies shape details and
requirements for each account, including when accounts should be
locked out or disabled.
There are a wide range of authentication methods and technologies
deployed throughout organizations. In addition, technologies like
RADIUS, LDAP, EAP and CHAP, OAuth, OpenID, and SAML are
commonly used as part of single sign-on infrastructure. Single sign-on
(SSO) allows users to log in once and use their identities throughout
many systems, whereas federation uses identity providers to
authenticate users, who can then use those identities at various service
providers and relying party locations without having to have a distinct
identity there. Interoperability between identity and authorization
systems is enabled by standards and shared protocols, making
federation possible. Attestation provides validation that a user or
identity belongs to the user claiming it.
Multifactor authentication has helped limit the problems with
passwords such as password theft, reuse, and brute-force attacks.
Biometric authentication, which uses physical traits such as your
fingerprint, retina print, or facial recognition, have become
commonplace, but knowing how often they will incorrectly allow the
wrong person in or reject a legitimate user is critical. Both hardware-
and software-based authentication tokens are commonly used, with
hardware security keys becoming increasingly common. Password
vaults (or safes) provide cryptographically secured storage to keep
passwords secure, and enterprise deployments support multiple users
and controlled access schemes.
Password best practices have changed as multifactor authentication
has become more common. While configurations still often allow
settings for length, complexity, reuse, expiration, and age, NIST and
other organizations have begun to focus on length as the primary
control to avoid brute forcing. Passwordless authentication is
becoming more common, replacing passwords with secure tokens or
applications.
Access control schemes like attribute-based access control,
discretionary access control, mandatory access control, and role-based
access control all provide ways to determine which subjects can
perform actions on objects. Privileged access management ensures
that administrative users are well managed. Just-in-time permissions
and ephemeral accounts are two of the many techniques that PAM
systems employ to enable better control of privileged accounts.

**Identities are the foundation of authentication and
authorization.** Users claim an identity through an authentication
process. In addition to usernames, identities are often claimed
through the use of certificates, tokens, SSH keys, or smartcards, each
of which provides additional capabilities or features that can help with
security or other useful functions. Identities use attributes to describe
the user, with various attributes like job, title, or even personal traits
stored as part of that user's identity.

**Single sign-on and federation are core elements of many
identity infrastructures**. Single sign-on (SSO) is widely used to
allow users to log in once and use resources and services across an
organization or federation. While there are many SSO technologies
and implementations, LDAP, OAuth, and SAML are critical for many
modern SSO designs.
**Passwords, passwordless authentication, and multifactor
authentication all have roles to play in authentication
systems**. Passwords best practices include configuration common
settings like password length, complexity, reuse, expiration, and age.
Understanding what each setting helps with and why it might be
configured to specific settings is an important task for security
professionals. Password managers help to limit password reuse and to
manage passwords for organizations when implemented with
enterprise solutions. Multifactor authentication relies on additional
factors beyond passwords, including biometrics and hardware- and
software-based tokens like security keys and authenticator
applications. Multifactor requires the use of distinct factors: potential
factors include something you know, something you have, something
you are, or somewhere you are.

**Account types and account policies determine what users
can do and privileged accounts must be managed and
controlled.** Types of user accounts include users, guests,
administrative (privileged) accounts, and service accounts.
Provisioning and deprovisioning accounts as well as managing the
account life cycle are key to ensuring that accounts have appropriate
rights and that they do not remain after they are no longer needed.
Privileged access management focuses on privileged accounts and
rights, and leverages techniques like just-in-time permission granting
and removal and short-lived, ephemeral accounts that exist just for the
time needed to accomplish a task.

**Access control schemes determine what rights accounts
have.** Important access control schemes include attribute-based
access control (ABAC), which employs user attributes to determine
what access the user should get. Role-based access control (RBAC)
makes decisions based on roles, whereas rule-based access control
(also sometimes called RBAC) uses rules to control access. In addition
to knowing these access control schemes, be familiar with mandatory
access control (MAC), which relies on the system administrator to
control access, and discretionary access control (DAC), which allows
users to make decisions about access to files and directories they have
rights to. PAM (privileged access management) is focused on
controlling administrative accounts. Finally, test takers also need to
know how to use and apply common filesystem permissions.
