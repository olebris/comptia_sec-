- Update is recommended but can have issues
    - always have a backup
- confirm the source of update
    - visit developer site directly
    - some OS allows only signed apps (don’t disable this check)
    - verify updates code signature (if exists)
- Automatic updates relatively safe but not always (Solarwinds)
