- Result of a bad programming
- SQL Injection
    - Structured Query Language
    - SQLi: put your own SQL request in the app
    
    Ex:

- reflected SQLi
    - you see sql error or you see the effect of your injction
- blind SQLi
    - you don’t see the effect on the website directly
    - blind “timing base” SQLi `52019 '; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:15'; --`  if the answer is delayed it means your SQLi works. Then you can brute force based on timing answer and guess the Database Schema
