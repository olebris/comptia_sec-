- Keep track of all transactions ( distributed ledger / registre)
- Transaction is verified by every node/computer in a decentralized network
- Practical use :
    - Payment
    - Identification
    - Supply chain monitoring
    - Digital voting
- Transaction are shared to every nodes
- Transaction are added to a block with a hash off all transactions of the block for integrity
- New block is added with 1 hash of new transactions + 1 hash of previous bloc transactions
