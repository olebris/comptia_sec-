- make password strong
- increase entropy
    - mix number, char, spc. char
    - not obvious
- length > 8
- use password manager
- passwordless authentification
    - facial recognition
    - biometrics
    - security key
- just in time permissions
    - use of clearingHouse = VAULT
    - create a time-limit account or token
    - primary password never revealed
