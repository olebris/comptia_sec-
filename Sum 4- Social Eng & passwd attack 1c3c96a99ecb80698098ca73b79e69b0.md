Social engineering techniques focus on human reactions and
psychology to gather information and to perform attacks against
individuals and organizations. A broad range of human vectors are
used to accomplish attackers' goals.
Security professionals need to be aware of how social engineering is
leveraged in attacks like phishing, impersonation, misinformation and
disinformation, and other efforts. Each technique has its own
distinctive set of social engineering techniques and impacts that help
make it unique. Test takers need to be familiar with phishing, vishing,
business email compromise, pretexting, watering hole, brand
impersonation, and typosquatting attacks as well as the broad
categories of phishing and impersonation, and misinformation.
Test takers need to be aware of brute-force password attacks that try
repeatedly using a variety of usernames and passwords until they
succeed. You'll also need to know about spraying, a type of brute-force
attack that uses a list of usernames and common passwords to try to
gain access to accounts.

**Many techniques are used for social engineering.** Many
adversarial and security techniques rely on social engineering.
Phishing and its related techniques of smishing and vishing seek to
gain information using social engineering techniques. Misinformation
and disinformation campaigns are used to change opinions and to
shift narratives. Malicious actors will impersonate whomever they
need to acquire information, to gain access or credentials, or to
persuade individuals to take action. Pretexting is often used with
impersonation to provide a believable reason for the action or request.
Business email compromise and brand impersonation are both used to
make malicious emails and other communications appear legitimate
and thus more likely to fool targets into taking desired action.
Watering hole attacks focus on sites that target frequently visit, while
typosquatters rely on users who make typos while entering URLs.

**Passwords can be acquired and cracked in many ways.**
Password attacks can be conducted both online against live systems
and offline using captured password stores. Brute-force attacks like
spraying and dictionary attacks as well as password cracking can
recover passwords in many circumstances. Unencrypted or plain-text
passwords and improper or unsecure storage methods like the use of
MD5 hashes make attacks even easier for attackers who can access
them.
