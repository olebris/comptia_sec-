- Worms can reproduce itself
    - self replication
    - self network propagation
    - self install
- Virus types
    - program virus
    - script virus
    - boot sector virus
    - macro virus (MS office)
    - can self replicate but not self-spreading through network
    - need a trigger and a payload
- Fileless Virus
    - in memory
    - never installed (good AV evasion)
- Mitigation:
    - IDS / IPS good worm prevention
    - Firewall
    - EDR
    - Network segmentation
    - Patching
    - limit attack surface
    - whipping the drive and reinstall backup
