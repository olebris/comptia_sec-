- Least Privilege
- MAC Mandatory Access Control
    - based on labels (confidential, secret, top secret)
        - decided by admin
        - user cannot change settings
- DAC Discretionary Access control
    - owner control who has access
    - flexible access control but weak security
- RBAC Role Based access  control
    - based on role (manager, team lead , user ..)
    - easy to implement / maintain
- Rule-base Access Control
    - generic for rules not based on who you are
    - rules depend on the object
        - ex: lab network open from 9AM to 5PM
- ABAC Role base on attributes
    - more flexible
    - combine different criteria
