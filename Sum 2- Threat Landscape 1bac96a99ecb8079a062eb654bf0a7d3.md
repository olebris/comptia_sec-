Cybersecurity professionals must have a strong working
understanding of the threat landscape in order to assess the risks
facing their organizations and the controls required to mitigate those
risks. Cybersecurity threats may be classified based on their internal or
external status, their level of sophistication and capability, their
resources and funding, and their intent and motivation.
Threat actors take many forms, ranging from relatively
unsophisticated/unskilled attackers who are simply seeking the thrill
of a successful hack to advanced nation-state actors who use
cyberattacks as a military weapon to achieve political advantage.
Hacktivists, organized crime, competitors, and other threat actors may
all target the same organizations for different reasons.
Cyberattacks come through a variety of threat vectors. The most
common vectors include email and social media; other attacks may
come through direct physical access, supply chain exploits, network-
based attacks, and other vectors. Organizations should build robust
threat intelligence programs to help them stay abreast of emerging
threats and adapt their controls to function in a changing
environment.

**Threat actors differ in several key attributes**. We can classify
threat actors using four major criteria. First, threat actors may be
internal to the organization, or they may come from external sources.
Second, threat actors differ in their level of sophistication and
capability. Third, they differ in their available resources and funding.
Finally, different threat actors have different motivations and levels of
intent.

**Threat actors come from many different sources**. Threat
actors may be very simplistic in their techniques, such as unskilled
attackers using exploit code written by others, or quite sophisticated,
such as the advanced persistent threat posed by nation-state actors
and organized crime. Hacktivists may seek to carry out political
agendas, whereas competitors may seek financial gain. Employees and
other users may pose an insider threat by working from within to
attack your organization. The use of unapproved shadow IT systems
may also expose your data to risk.

**Attackers have varying motivations for their attacks**.
Attackers may be motivated by many different drivers. Common
motivations for attack include data exfiltration, espionage, service
disruption, blackmail, financial gain, philosophical or political beliefs,
revenge, disruption and chaos, or war. Some attackers may believe
they are behaving ethically and acting in the best interests of society.

**Attackers exploit different vectors to gain initial access to an
organization.** Attackers may attempt to gain initial access to an
organization remotely over the Internet, through a wireless
connection, or by attempting direct physical access. They may also
approach employees over email or social media. Attackers may seek to
use removable media to trick employees into unintentionally
compromising their networks, or they may seek to spread exploits
through cloud services. Sophisticated attackers may attempt to
interfere with an organization's supply chain.

**Threat intelligence provides organizations with valuable
insight into the threat landscape**. Security teams may leverage
threat intelligence from public and private sources to learn about
current threats and vulnerabilities. They may seek out detailed
indicators of compromise and perform predictive analytics on their
own data. Threat intelligence teams often supplement open source and
closed source intelligence that they obtain externally with their own
research.

**Security teams must monitor for supply chain risks**. Modern
enterprises depend on hardware, software, and cloud service vendors
to deliver IT services to their internal and external customers. Vendor
management techniques protect the supply chain against attackers
seeking to compromise these external links into an organization's
network. Security professionals should pay particular attention to
risks posed by outsourced code development, cloud data storage, and
integration between external and internal systems
