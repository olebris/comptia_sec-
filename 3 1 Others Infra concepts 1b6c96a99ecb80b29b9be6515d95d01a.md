- on-premises Vs cloud-based infra
- On-premises
    - full control on security
    - local team maintains availability
- Centralized Vs Decentralized Infra
    - Centralized:
        - correlated alerts
        - consolidated logs
        - easy to maintain / update / monitor
        - Single point of failure !!
- Virtualization
    - run many OS in same physical Host
    - adds complexity, maintenance and overhead
    - relatively expensive
- Containerization
    - isolated apps
    - standardized unit of software for portability
- IoT - Internet of things
    - sensors
    - smart devices
    - wearable technology
    - a lot of security weakness !!
- Scada (Supervisory Control And Data Aquisition) systems
    - popular ICS (Industrial Control Systems)
    - manage power, manufacturing equipments â€¦
    - requires extensive segmentation
- RTOS (Real Time OS)
    - industrial equipment
    - military equipment
    - only one process / one goal for this kind of OS
- Embedded Systems
    - part of larger system
    - optimize for size and cost
- HA - High Availability
    - always on / available equipment
    - active / active configuration
    - higher costs
