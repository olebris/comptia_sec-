Cybersecurity professionals are responsible for ensuring the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems
maintained by their organizations. Confidentiality ensures that
unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive
information. Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized
modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or
unintentionally. Availability ensures that information and systems are
ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users
request them. Together, these three goals are known as the CIA triad.
As cybersecurity analysts seek to protect their organizations, they
must evaluate risks to the CIA triad. This includes the design and
implementation of an appropriate mixture of security controls drawn
from the managerial, operational, technical, and physical control
categories. These controls should also be varied in type, including a
mixture of preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, compensating,
and directive controls.

**The three core objectives of cybersecurity are
confidentiality, integrity, and availability.** 

**Confidentiality**
ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to
sensitive information. 

**Integrity** ensures that there are no unauthorized
modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or
unintentionally. 

**Availability** ensures that information and systems are
ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users
request them.
**Nonrepudiation** prevents someone from denying that they
took an action. Nonrepudiation means that someone who
performed some action, such as sending a message, cannot later deny
having taken that action. Digital signatures are a common example of
nonrepudiation. They allow anyone who is interested to confirm that a
message truly originated with its purported sender.

**Security controls** may be categorized based on their
mechanism of action and their intent. Controls are grouped into
the categories of managerial, operational, physical, and technical
based on the way that they achieve their objectives. They are divided
into the types of preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent,
compensating, and directive based on their intended purpose.

**Data breaches have significant and diverse impacts on
organizations.** When an organization suffers a data breach, the
resulting data loss often results in both direct and indirect damages.
The organization suffers immediate financial repercussions due to the
costs associated with the incident response, as well as long-term
financial consequences due to reputational damage. This reputational
damage may be difficult to quantify, but it also may have a lasting
impact. In some cases, organizations may suffer operational damage if
they experience availability damages, preventing them from accessing
their own information.

**Data must be protected in transit, at rest, and in use.**
Attackers may attempt to eavesdrop on network transmissions
containing sensitive information. This information is highly vulnerable
when in transit unless protected by encryption technology. Attackers
also might attempt to breach data stores, stealing data at rest.
Encryption serves to protect stored data as well as data in transit. Data
is also vulnerable while in use on a system and should be protected
during data processing activities.

**Data loss prevention** systems block data exfiltration attempts.

DLP technology enforces information handling policies to
prevent data loss and theft. DLP systems may function at the host
level, using software agents to search systems for the presence of
sensitive information. They may also work at the network level,
watching for transmissions of unencrypted sensitive information. DLP
systems detect sensitive information using pattern-matching
technology and/or digital watermarking.

**Data minimization reduces risk by reducing the amount of
sensitive information that we maintain.** In cases where we
cannot simply discard unnecessary information, we can protect
information through deidentification and data obfuscation. The tools
used to achieve these goals include hashing, tokenization, and
masking of sensitive fields
