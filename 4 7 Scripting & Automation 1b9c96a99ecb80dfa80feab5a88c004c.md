- automate and orchestrate
    - save time & Achieving efficiency
    - enforce security baseline
    - standardize configurations
    - better scaling in a secure manner
    - less boring tasks / Retaining employees
    - fast reaction time
    - reduce errors
    - auditable code
    - Serving as a workforce multiplier
    
    Other considerations:
    
    - Increase Complexity
    - Additional Cost
    - Single point of failure
    - Technical debt
    - Ongoing supportability
    
- Automation Use cases
    - User provisioning: Automated scripts can handle the process
    of adding, modifying, or removing user access to systems and
    networks, reducing manual efforts and human error.
    - Resource provisioning: Scripts can automate the allocation
    and deallocation of system resources, ensuring optimal
    performance and reducing the burden on IT staff.
    - Guard rails: Automation can be employed to enforce policy
    controls and prevent violations of security protocols.
    - Security groups: Automated processes can manage security
    group memberships, ensuring users have appropriate
    permissions.
    - Ticket creation: Automation can streamline the ticketing
    process, enabling immediate creation and routing of issues to the
    right teams.
    - Escalation: In case of a major incident, scripts can automate the
    escalation process, alerting key personnel quickly.
    - Enabling/disabling services and access: Automation can be
    used to turn services or access on or off based on certain triggers
    or conditions.
    - Continuous integration and testing: Scripts can automate
    the build and test process, ensuring faster and more reliable
    software delivery.
    - Integrations and APIs: Automated processes can handle data
    exchange between different software applications through APIs,
    enhancing interoperability.
