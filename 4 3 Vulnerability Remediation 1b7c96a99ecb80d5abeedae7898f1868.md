- Patching is the common mitigation
- Cybersecurity Insurance
    - Risk transference
    - Legal support
- Segmentation
    - use VLAN to limit scope of exploit
    - use NGFW between VLAN
- Compensating control
    - disable a compromise service
    - revoke service access
    - limit internal access

Remember that good vulnerability response and remediation
practices include patching, insurance, segmentation, compensating
controls, exceptions, and exemption
