Policies form the basis of every strong information security program. A
solid policy framework consists of policies, standards, procedures, and
guidelines that work together to describe the security control
environment of an organization. In addition to complying with
internally developed policies, organizations often must comply with
externally imposed compliance obligations. Security frameworks, such
as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001, provide a
common structure for security programs based on accepted industry
best practices. Organizations should implement and test security
controls to achieve security control objectives that are developed based
on the business and technical environment of the organization.

**Security governance practices ensure that organizations
achieve their strategic objectives.** Governance programs are the
sets of procedures and controls put in place to allow an organization to
effectively direct its work. Governance programs may involve the
participation of a variety of boards, committees, and government
regulators. Centralized governance models use a top-down approach
that dictates how subordinate units meet security objectives, whereas
decentralized governance models delegate the authority for meeting
security objectives as the subordinate units see fit.

**Policy frameworks consist of policies, standards,
procedures, and guidelines**. Policies are high-level statements of
management intent for the information security program. Standards
describe the detailed implementation requirements for policy.
Procedures offer step-by-step instructions for carrying out security
activities. Compliance with policies, standards, and procedures is
mandatory. Guidelines offer optional advice that complements other
elements of the policy framework.

**Organizations often adopt a set of security policies covering
different areas of their security programs**. Common policies
used in security programs include an information security policy, an
acceptable use policy, a data ownership policy, a data retention policy,
an account management policy, and a password policy. The specific
policies adopted by any organization will depend on that
organization's culture and business needs.

**Policy documents should include exception processes.**
Exception processes should outline the information required to receive
an exception to security policy and the approval authority for each
exception. The process should also describe the requirements for
compensating controls that mitigate risks associated with approved
security policy exceptions.

**Change management is crucial to ensuring the availability of
systems and applications.** The primary goal of change
management is to ensure that changes do not cause outages. Change
management processes ensure that appropriate personnel review and
approve changes before implementation and ensure that personnel
test and document the changes. Change review processes should
carefully evaluate the potential impact of any change.

**Organizations face a variety of security compliance
requirements.** Merchants and credit card service providers must
comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI
DSS). Organizations handling the personal information of European
Union residents must comply with the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). All organizations should be familiar with the
national, territory, and state laws that affect their operations.

**Standards frameworks provide an outline for structuring
and evaluating cybersecurity programs**. Organizations may
choose to base their security programs on a framework, such as the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) or International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) standards. U.S. federal government agencies
and contractors should also be familiar with the NIST Risk
Management Framework (RMF). These frameworks sometimes
include maturity models that allow an organization to assess its
progress. Some frameworks also offer certification programs that
provide independent assessments of an organization's progress toward
adopting a framework.

**Security training and awareness ensures that individuals
understand their responsibilities**. Security training programs
impart new knowledge on employees and other stakeholders. They
should be tailored to meet the specific requirements of an individual's
role in the organization. Security awareness programs seek to remind
users of the information they have already learned, keeping their
security responsibilities top-of-mind
