- Jailbreaking / rooting
    - bypass security and open vulnerabilities
    - bypass MDM (mobile device manager)
- Malicious app
    - sideloading (install out of the play/AppStore)
- mobile problems
    - always online
    - easy to lost
    - always in motion
- Use **MDM** (mobile device manager) to control organization mobiles
    - manage installation source (private store)
    - white listing apps
    - allow remote wipe
    - change app settings
    - geolocation/ geofencing
    - screen lock / passwords / pin options settings
    - content management (need a MDM app to view business data)
    - Containerization tools can help split devices between work
    and personal-use environments
    - data encryption
    - push notification
    - unified endpoint management (UEM) = MDM + Desktops/Laptops
- BYOD / CYOD (choose your own device) / COPE - company own personally enabled) / COBO (company own business only)

- Containerization
    - separation for apps and data
- storage segmentation
    - only to separate data (with containerisation or not) and often encrypt business data
