- Jailbreaking / rooting
    - bypass security and open vulnerabilities
    - bypass MDM (mobile device manager)
- Malicious app
    - sideloading (install out of the play/AppStore)
- mobile problems
    - always online
    - easy to lost
    - always in motion
- Use **MDM** (mobile device manager) to control organization mobiles
    - manage installation source (private store)
